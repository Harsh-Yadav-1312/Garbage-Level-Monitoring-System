The project aims to develop a garbage level monitoring system using an ultrasonic
sensor,LCD(16 X 2) and an Arduino board. The system is designed to measure the level of
garbage in a bin and display the information using two LEDs,a buzzer and lcd. The ultrasonic
sensor detects the distance of the garbage from the top of the bin and sends the
data to the Arduino board. The board processes the data and activates one of the
LEDs to indicate whether the garbage level is high or low. The system helps to
optimize garbage collection schedules, reduces overflow, and keeps the
environment clean.
